insert(int element)
    - takes int type parameter of the value to be inserted
    - check if the heap is full
        prompt overflow error message
    - insert the element at the end of the queue
        at the position of heapsize++
    - while the index of the heap elements is not 0
      and if the parent is found to be greater than the child
        swap the parent and the child
    - returns nothing

extractMin()
    - takes no parameter 
    - if the heapsize is lessthan or 0
        retrun -1
    - if the heapsize is 1
        decrement heapsize by 1
        and return first element in the heap
    - assign the root to be the first element in the heap
    - then heapify to mantain heap property
    - returns the least element

MinHeapify(int i)
    - takes int i
    - intialize left and right nodes of the current node
    - let the current element be the least
    - find the least element 
    - bring it to the top
    -returns nothing

HeapSort(vector, int n)
    - set the heapsize for the length of array given as paramter
    - build the heap using MinHeapify than inserting
    - extract the min element by looping throug the heap than using extractMin
